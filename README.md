# Quiz-MERN

This is a WebApp solution created for holding quiz competitions on a CBT platform.
It was initially developed on Flask, for the Prelims Round of the TechQuiz, the Quiz Event of Technovation 2022. (Technovation is the name of our department tech fest). Now I have taken it up as a full-stack project on MERN.

Tools and Languages used:
1. Designing and Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5), JS, Tailwind CSS
2. API: FetchAPI, JQuery
3. Frameworks: React.js, Node.js
4. Databases: MongoDB

I hope to expand this project into a comprehensive software solution for holding exams in CBT platform in schools and colleges. Ever since COVID came into effect, there has been a rise in the requirement of CBT oriented exam patterns, and I hope that I provide a solution to the same.
